## Prototype II (2020)

With iOS now allowing me to connect to multiple bluetooth devices, I am using an audio bluetooth module on my board to collect the audio data wirelessly. I'll probably call Apple and complain in order to bring back bluetooth compatability to devices outside their "ecosystem" of H1 and W1 chips, because the capability exists and it's simply an uncalled for power move to limit . If they don't, then I'll just have to use multiple devices and the app ampME to connect to multiple devices, which is just so inconvenient >:(.
