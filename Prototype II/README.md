## Prototype II (2020)

With iOS now allowing me to connect to multiple bluetooth devices, I am using an audio bluetooth module on my board to collect the audio data wirelessly. I'll probably call Apple and complain in order to bring back bluetooth compatability to devices outside their "ecosystem" of H1 and W1 chips, because the capability exists (there are youtube videos proving so) and it's simply an uncalled for power move to limit user scope. If they don't, then I'll just have to use multiple devices and the app ampME to connect to multiple devices, which is just so inconvenient >:(.

AmpMe isn't all that great, so I have decided to downgrade and buy a microphone, because progress must go on >:). Also to better create the visualizer and analyze the data I have decided to learn Processing which can read and analyze the data through my serial ports and
