## Music-Visualizer
While attending college parties, one of things that I wanted to improve for my experience, at my place, were LED lights that would react to music, essentially allowing the music to envelope my home. "This is going to be lit" I told myself at the beginning of the summer before sophomore year, at the start of this endeavor. Little did I understand the endeavor I would be taking on. As I started progressing through college, though, I started thinking about different ways to profit off of the party culture on college campuses and city night life, and I hope this could become something more than just that, where it can be incoorporated into everyday households as music becomes a very prominent part of life for a growing population.
