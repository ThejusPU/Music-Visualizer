## Prototype I (2018) 

This idea comes from Devon Crawford, a programming youtuber, who used a frequency to voltage circuit to find the frequencies running through an aux chord as voltage which was then read by the arduino. I played around with the electronics without much knowledge for them and found values on the arduino that I thought I could work with. I also directly fed the aux data into the arduino, and used both of which to program different methods to visualize the music. I used music.ino, by Devon Crawford, as a launching pad for my own programs and patterns.

At the time, if I had done more research on audio analysis I should've taken the audio sample and used arduinoFHT to find the frequencies making the music, which is what I do in Prototype II, along with a few new features :)
