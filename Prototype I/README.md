## Prototype I (2018) 

This idea comes from Devon Crawford, a programming youtuber, who used a circuit to find the frequencies running through an aux chord as voltage which was then read by the arduino. I found my own circuit online, frequency-to-voltage-circuit.png, so that I could derive the frequency from the waveform in the form of voltage readings, which I fed into the Arduino. I also directly fed the aux data into the arduino, and used both of which to program different methods to visualize the music. I used the code inside DEVON_code, created by Devon Crawford, as a launching pad for my own programs and patterns.
